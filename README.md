# SASS Demo Website

This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) in creating modern, responsive web designs.

## Project Overview

This demo website showcases various SASS features including:

- Variables for consistent color schemes and typography
- Nesting for more intuitive CSS structure
- Mixins for reusable style patterns
- Functions for dynamic value calculations
- Responsive design techniques

The layout features an asymmetrical design with a sidebar navigation, demonstrating how SASS can be used to create complex layouts efficiently.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file
- `styles.scss`: The SASS file containing all our styles
- `styles.css`: The compiled CSS file (generated from styles.scss)
